What does the `No U` bot do?
----------------------------
When this bot is added to your server it checks every message including an @mention against PerspectiveAPI (https://www.perspectiveapi.com/)

If the API rates the messages toxicity 80%+ he bot will randomly choose between 4 reverse cards (red, yellow, green, and blue)

This card will be sent to the channel the message was received in.
