What does the `No U` bot do?
----------------------------
When this bot is added to your server it checks every messages sent against a list of over 200 insult words.

If the word is included in the message a user sends the bot will randomly choose between 4 reverse cards (red, yellow, green, and blue)

This card will be sent to the channel the message was received in.
